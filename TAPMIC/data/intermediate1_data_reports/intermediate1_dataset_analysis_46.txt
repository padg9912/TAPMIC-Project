# 4.6 Preprocessing Needs Analysis
Generated on: 2025-04-22 01:15:32

This report compiles preprocessing requirements identified through comprehensive analysis of the binary classification dataset (analyses 4.1-4.5). It summarizes key findings and translates them into actionable preprocessing steps required for optimal model performance.

## 1. Class Distribution Analysis Summary (from 4.1)

- **Class Distribution**: TRUE (55.77%) vs FALSE (44.23%)
- **Imbalance Ratio**: 1.26 (relatively balanced)
- **Recommendation**: Minor class imbalance is present but not severe enough to require aggressive balancing techniques.

## 2. Missing Value Handling (from 4.3)

### High Priority Missing Values

| Column | Missing % | Recommendation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| speaker_job | 27.89% | Fill with special 'UNKNOWN' category + create binary flag feature |
| state | 21.51% | Fill with special 'UNKNOWN' category + create binary flag feature |
| context | 1.02% | Fill with special 'UNKNOWN' category |

### Low Priority Missing Values (all < 0.05%)

| Column | Missing % | Recommendation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| subject | 0.02% | Fill with most common value |
| speaker | 0.02% | Fill with special 'UNKNOWN' value |
| party | 0.02% | Fill with special 'UNKNOWN' value |
| truth history columns | 0.02% | Fill with 0 (assuming no previous statements) |

## 3. Categorical Field Preprocessing (from 4.4)

### High Cardinality Categorical Fields

| Field | Unique Values | Statistical Significance | Recommended Encoding |
|-------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| subject | 4,535 | p < 0.001 | Target encoding + group sparse categories |
| speaker | 3,310 | p < 0.001 | Target encoding + group sparse categories |
| speaker_job | 1,355 | p < 0.001 | Target encoding or frequency encoding |
| context | 5,143 | p < 0.001 | Target encoding + group sparse categories |

### Low Cardinality Categorical Fields

| Field | Unique Values | Statistical Significance | Recommended Encoding |
|-------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| state | 85 | p < 0.001 | One-hot encoding or target encoding |
| party | 25 | p < 0.001 | One-hot encoding |

### Categorical Feature Grouping

Based on correlation analysis, some categories have strong predictive power:

- Create special features for speakers with extreme truth ratios:
  - Highly credible speakers (e.g., kasim-reed, dennis-kucinich)
  - Low credibility speakers (e.g., chain-email, viral-image, blog-posting)
  
- Create binary features for contexts with strong predictive power:
  - Formal contexts (e.g., State of the Union, newspaper column) → associated with TRUE
  - Informal contexts (e.g., chain email, blog post) → associated with FALSE

## 4. Text Preprocessing (from 4.2, 4.4)

### Statement Field Requirements

- **Basic Preprocessing**:
  - Lowercase conversion
  - Punctuation removal
  - Number standardization (e.g., convert "50 percent" to "50%")
  - Stop word removal (optional, evaluate impact)
  
- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Statement length (characters)
  - Word count
  - Average word length
  - Counting specific key terms
  - Sentiment analysis scores
  
- **Advanced Representations**:
  - TF-IDF vectorization
  - Word embeddings (word2vec, GloVe)
  - BERT or similar contextual embeddings

## 5. Speaker History Features (from 4.2, 4.4, 4.5)

The following features show strong correlation with truth labels:

| Feature | Correlation | Mutual Information | Recommendation |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Credibility score | 0.5481 | 0.1455 | High priority, required |
| Weighted credibility | 0.4280 | 0.1233 | High priority, required |

### Required History Feature Engineering:

- **Simple Ratio Features**:
  - Credibility score: truth_statements / total_statements
  - Lie ratio: lie_statements / total_statements
  
- **Weighted Features**:
  - Weighted credibility (with different weights for different truth categories)
  - Normalize counts by total statements

## 6. Feature Interaction and Engineering (from 4.5)

### Statistical Feature Engineering:

- **Interaction Terms**:
  - Create interaction features between statement length and speaker credibility
  - Create interaction features between party and context
  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - Use PCA to reduce dimensionality of high-cardinality categorical features
  - The first two principal components explain 77.32% of variance

### Feature Selection Strategy:

1. **Core Features**:
   - Speaker credibility metrics (highest correlation and MI)
   - Properly encoded categorical features (speaker, subject, context)
   - Text-based features from statements
   
2. **Derived Features**:
   - Interaction terms
   - PCA components
   - Grouped categorical features

## 7. Comprehensive Preprocessing Pipeline Requirements

Based on all analyses, the preprocessing pipeline should include:

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values as specified in section 2
- Convert categorical values to lowercase for consistency
- Standardize date formats and numerical values

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Create speaker credibility and weighted history features
- Extract text features from statements
- Generate interaction terms and transformed features
- Create binary flags for missing values in key fields

### 3. Categorical Encoding
- Apply appropriate encoding strategies for each categorical field
- Group sparse categories to reduce dimensionality
- Create special features for highly predictive categories

### 4. Text Processing
- Implement basic text preprocessing (lowercase, punctuation removal)
- Generate text-based features (length, counts, sentiment)
- Apply appropriate text representation technique (TF-IDF, embeddings)

### 5. Feature Selection and Scaling
- Use correlation and mutual information to guide feature selection
- Consider dimensionality reduction for high-cardinality features
- Apply appropriate scaling (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler)

### 6. Class Balancing (Optional)
- For some algorithms, consider mild oversampling of the minority class
- Alternative: Use class weights in model training

## 8. Implementation Priorities

Based on impact and implementation difficulty:

### High Priority (Essential)
1. Missing value handling (especially for speaker_job and state)
2. Speaker credibility score calculation
3. Basic text preprocessing and feature extraction
4. Appropriate encoding of categorical variables

### Medium Priority (Important)
1. Feature interaction terms
2. Advanced text representation (TF-IDF or embeddings)
3. Binning/grouping of high-cardinality categorical variables
4. PCA for dimensionality reduction

### Lower Priority (Optional)
1. Class balancing techniques
2. Advanced text feature engineering
3. Complex feature transformations

## 9. Conclusion

The preprocessing requirements identified through analyses 4.1-4.5 provide a comprehensive roadmap for preparing the binary classification dataset for modeling. The most critical preprocessing needs involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables appropriately, creating speaker credibility features, and implementing basic text preprocessing.

By implementing these preprocessing steps in the correct sequence, we can maximize the predictive power of the dataset while addressing potential issues that could impact model performance.
