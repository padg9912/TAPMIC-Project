=== DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION ===
Components needed for 90% variance: 45
Variance explained by first component: 14.50%
Variance explained by first 5 components: 32.21%

=== CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS ===
1. Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction:
   - Consider using PCA to reduce dimensions (need 45 components for 90% variance)
   - Focus on top temporal features with highest correlation to truth label
2. Model Development Strategy:
   - Temporal features provide complementary signal to content features, use ensemble approaches
3. Evidence Source Considerations:
   - Evidence sources show similar patterns, can be treated uniformly
4. Handling Missing Temporal Data:
   - Temporal features have good coverage, minimal handling of missing data needed
